On October 12, 2022, the national standard 'GB/T18801-2022A6 Air Cleaner' was released and officially implemented on May 1, 2023.\n\nNew The release of the national standard has attracted a lot of attention in the air purifier industry. On the one hand, the problem of the mismatch between the old standard and the new product technology is more prominent; on the other hand, the air purifier market is constantly falling, and the industry expects the new standard The market has a positive driving effect.",
    "airCleanerText2": "Data from Aoweiyun.com shows that the sales of domestic air purifiers reached a peak of 7.25 million units in 2017, and then began to decline year after year, plummeting 27% to 5.29 million units in 2018; In 2021, the retail sales of air purifiers in China will be 3.83 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 2%; in 2022, there will be only 2.84 million units left, which is 60% less than in 2017 .\n\nThe deep downturn in the air purifier market is affected by the overall downturn of the home appliance industry in recent years, and it is also related to the industry’s delay in getting rid of the fate of 'depending on the sky'. Major General Ding, a senior home appliance industry analyst, believes that in the future With the advancement of consumption upgrading, the continuous progress of the industry in terms of functional integration and intelligence, and the positive driving effect on the industry after the implementation of the new national standard, the air purifier market is expected to recover steadily.\n\nDing Technology Network noted that, Compared with the old standard, the new national standard has made many changes, such as paying more attention to the durability of products and functions, paying more attention to the monitoring and removal of pollutants in real environments, and adding standard requirements for virus removal capabilities, as well as power consumption, New standards have been set for mute and other capabilities.\n\nThe introduction of the new national standard is conducive to promoting the industrial upgrading of air purifiers, further regulating the market, and accelerating the survival of the fittest. At the same time, it can also serve as a consumption guide that is more in line with market conditions and scene needs Function.\n\nFor consumers, the purchase of air purifiers can be compared with the new national standard, and comprehensively evaluated in terms of functional durability, virus removal ability, secondary odor removal ability, comfort, etc.\n\n For example, the new national standard correlates the clean air volume CADR value of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants (formaldehyde) with the cumulative purification volume CCM value, and establishes the corresponding relationship between product optimization design and filter material. CADR reflects the initial performance, and CCM reflects Durability; the new national standard is based on a large number of experimental verification data, adding a method for evaluating the performance of purifiers to remove viruses.\n\nDing Technology Network believes that for enterprises, on the one hand, it is necessary to clean up old stocks in a timely manner, and at the same time compare the new national standard Timely optimize and upgrade product design, production, testing and other processes, and promptly remove products that do not meet the standards after the transition period; on the other hand, we should not be obsessed with the competition of a single parameter, and we must develop in combination with the real use scenarios and dynamically changing needs of users Products.\n\nIn the home appliance industry, in addition to air purifiers, the category of 'depending on the sky' also includes large appliances such as air conditioners. However, in recent years, the air conditioner industry has accelerated the pace of industrial upgrading, focusing on intelligent interaction, healthy fresh air, Personalized customization, scene interconnection, etc. have given the air conditioner consumer market a stronger impetus for renewal. Compared with air conditioners, air purifiers still have a lot of room for popular market dividends. The industry needs to strengthen technological innovation and scene innovation in order to be more To a large extent, we can get rid of the fate of 'depending on the sky'. ",
    "mouseText": "Rats are one of the oldest species in the world. Wherever humans live, there are rats. For thousands of years, they have brought serious harm to human social development, people's lives and even health. \n\nOne is to destroy furniture. Rats are born with sharp teeth and need to be shortened to eat and survive. The shortened teeth mainly eat iron and wood furniture, concrete floors, clothes and books, and even bricks. But it does not eat The purpose of these things is to shorten the teeth. Therefore, its sharp and chiseled teeth have become its lifelong weapon. In particular, its pair of hard, iron-like incisors are very sharp and continue to grow, with an average annual growth of 16 to 32 centimeters. If If the incisors are not shortened, the teeth will grow longer and longer, and it will open its upper jaw, unable to close its mouth, resulting in inability to eat and death. Therefore, mice must chew various objects 16,000 to 65,000 times a week to survive. Grind off the overlong teeth in order to eat and survive.\n\nThe second is to waste food and destroy farmland. The nature of mice and humans competing for food was ruthlessly exposed by the “Book of Songs · Wei Feng in the Spring and Autumn Period more than 3,000 years ago : 'Shu Shu Shuo Shu, no food for my millet! Three-year-old girl, Morkende. 'Although a mouse is small, it eats a lot. Individually speaking, a mouse eats 12 kilograms of grain a year and wastes 40 kilograms of grain. According to statistics, the amount of grain spoiled by mice around the world every year is enough to fill a 4,828-kilometer train. In China, 2.5 million tons of grain are wasted every year. The damage to farmland is also very serious, and about 1/4 of the farmland is destroyed by rodents every year. In 1982, more than 900 million mu of pasture grass in China suffered from rodent damage, and a total of 15 million acres of pasture grass were lost. billion kilograms. In recent years, the distribution density of rats in farmland has increased with the prosperity of their families. According to the observation and statistics of scientists, the number of rats per mu has increased from three to four in the past to thirty or forty now, and the highest in pastoral areas has reached four to five per mu. Hundreds of them. In addition, rats also have a superb ability to dig holes, and the solid river embankments will collapse due to the small holes they made, causing heavy losses. From late June to mid-July 2007, a species called The mouse called 'Oriental Vole' took advantage of the rising water of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, and more than 2 billion mice came out of their nests, digging holes and eating crops on the more than 4 million acres of lake beach in the Dongting Lake area, causing 22 counties and urban areas to die. The flood control levee along the lake and nearly 8 million mu of rice fields have been seriously damaged.\n\nThe third is the spread of diseases. Rats are infected with germs and viruses, and through contact with objects, there are at least 30 kinds of diseases that can be transmitted to humans. There are plague, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, leptospira, forest encephalitis, upper Laren disease, Qiang insect disease, brucellosis, spotted rash, typhoid fever, etc. Moreover, the mortality rate of these diseases is very high. Several major epidemics in history The plague has claimed the lives of more than 300 million people. In 540 BC, the plague killed 1 out of every 4 people in Europe. In 1348 AD, the plague was prevalent in the world. In just 3 years, it caused 25 million deaths in Europe People, more than 40 million people died in Asia, of which 13 million died in China. A plague that occurred at the end of the nineteenth century was popular in more than 30 countries, and the death toll far exceeded the total number of deaths in previous wars. In the autumn and winter of 1970, pneumonic plague was in It was prevalent in the three provinces of Northeast China, and 60,468 people died. At that time, the coffins of the deceased were lined up for more than one mile, and the tragedy was unbearable. In this regard, scholars of all ages also exposed and cursed mice in their poems. Liu Zongyuan, a writer of the Tang Dynasty, wrote in 'The Caged Eagle It is written in 'Ci': 'The raccoon in the grass is full of dangers, and it is frightened and cold overnight. 'A poem 'Dead Rats Walk' in the Qing Dynasty also wrote: 'Rats die in the east, rats die in the west, and people see rats as if they see tigers.' There are not many dead rats, but human death is like a wall. '",
    "mouseText2": "The alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the highest, largest and most unique grassland ecosystem in the world. A suitable population of rodents can maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but excessive rodents eat pastures, eat grass roots, destroy vegetation, dig holes and build mounds, lead to desertification of grasslands, spread diseases, and seriously affect the development of local animal husbandry. The grassland degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will have a serious impact on the ecology and development of surrounding areas and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. \n\nShiqu County, located on the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, belongs to Ganzi Prefecture, Sichuan Province, and is located at the junction of the three provinces (regions) of Sichuan, Qinghai and Tibet. The county covers an area of ​​25,191 square kilometers, with an average altitude of 4,526 meters. As the county with the largest area in Sichuan, Shiqu County is also the county with the largest area of ​​grassland rodents in Sichuan. According to data from 2021, Shiqu County has more than 31 million mu of natural grassland, 20.76 million mu of rodent infestation, and more than 16 million mu of severe rodent infestation, which is more than 60% more than that of Sichuan Province. According to the data, the rodent plague broke out in the grasslands in Northwest Sichuan in the early 1980s. By the early 1990s, there were more than 300 million mu of grassland in Sichuan Province, and the area of ​​rodent damage that was classified as severe reached more than 40 million mu, concentrated in Ganzi , Aba high altitude area. Among them, Ganzi Shiqu County has more than 20 million mu, accounting for more than half of the whole Sichuan. \n\nRat control in Shiqu began in the early 1980s. It has been 40 years since the county's rodent management has been moving forward with a balance between 'rats advance and people retreat' and 'humans advance and rats retreat'. After a long 'tug of war', the effectiveness of rodent control has been demonstrated in the past ten years, the spread of rodent damage has been brought under control, and the area of ​​severe rat wasteland has been reduced year by year. The data shows that the area of ​​severe rodent infestation in Shiqu County in 2021 will be 16.151 million mu, a decrease of about 7 million mu compared with the data in 1992. The effect is due to the comprehensive implementation of comprehensive management, including rodent control, grass planting, and grazing prohibition. This is not only the control of rodent damage, but the restoration of the entire grassland ecology. \n\nZhou Su, vice president of the Sichuan Academy of Forestry Sciences, said that understanding the relationship between grassland degradation and rodent damage is the key to comprehensive management. Rat control is not just rat control, but a comprehensive and systematic project. In the past few days, Red Star News reporters have visited a number of relevant personnel who have participated in this 40-year 'human-rat tug-of-war' to discuss the ecological balance between the 'human-rat conflict' on the plateau...",
    "airCleanerDetails": "The Beijing Winter Olympics has officially kicked off, and the prevention and control of the epidemic is very important. The reporter learned from Dalian University of Technology that a few days ago, the new coronavirus purifier developed based on the research results of Dalian University of Technology was officially put on duty in Beijing Winter Olympics Olympic Games.\n\nThe core filter material used in the purifier - the micro-mesoporous virus adsorption material was developed by the team of Professor Yang Dezheng of the School of Physics, Dalian University of Technology, which can efficiently absorb and kill coronaviruses, influenza A H1N1 viruses, etc. As The anti-epidemic scientific research products, purifiers are designated by the Olympic Organizing Committee to be placed in news media venues and athletes restaurants.\n\nAir disinfection during the event is an important part of blocking the spread of viruses, efficient protective equipment for pathogens and purification of airborne pathogens There is a high demand. Long-term and large-scale use of chemical disinfectants will not only harm the health of athletes, but excessive use in many places and environments will also cause persistent pollution. Physical killing methods such as ultraviolet light and high temperature are difficult to achieve man-machine coexistence Elimination. The team of Professor Yang Dezheng is committed to the development of new safe and healthy air purification technology that can effectively remove low-level and harmful substances such as viruses and macromolecular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in indoor air. The development of porous adsorption materials based on resin matrix and molecular sieve matrix can realize The efficient adsorption and complexation of the virus makes the virus lose its biological activity and transmission ability.\n\nIt is reported that the air purifier and disinfection machine manufactured by using this technology have passed a number of third-party tests on viruses and bacteria, and In a high-level laboratory, a living coronavirus test was carried out, and the comprehensive killing efficiency can reach as high as 99.98%.\n\nIn addition, the reporter also learned that Dalian University of Technology alumni participated in several important events at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. link.\n\nThe main torch and ignition method are the most eye-catching parts of the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The power mechanical device for the main torch 'big snowflake' rising slowly is provided by the 1983-level lifting and transportation machinery of Dalian University of Technology Professional alumni Wen Qinglin's entrepreneurial team. Not only that, Wen Qinglin's team also undertook the ground stage system design and supply and technical support, aerial facilities and equipment projects, ice screen performance devices, main torch attitude adjustment executive agencies, and Beijing, Yanqing, Chongli The research and development of turntables outside the three awards ceremonies is the company that undertakes the most stage machinery projects for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, a drop of ice-blue ink fell from the sky and turned into the water of the Yellow River It pours down, and the artistic conception of the picture comes from the ancient poem 'The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky', which shows the romance of the Chinese people to the world. During the whole opening ceremony performance, the ground screen, ice waterfall, ice cube, and the north and south screens of the bird's nest were all used The LED screen is used as the display terminal, and through the cooperation of the screen and the broadcast control system, a series of wonderful pictures are displayed. Among them, the broadcast control system Hirender, which plays a key role, was built by Li Lin, an alumnus of Dalian University of Technology in 2001 majoring in electronic information engineering. ."
